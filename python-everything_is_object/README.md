# 📚 Python - Everything is Object

Welcome to the **Python - Everything is Object** project! This repository is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on understanding Python's object model, memory management, and the behavior of variables and data structures. Let's dive into the fascinating world of Python objects! 🚀

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is designed to help you:
- Understand how Python handles objects and memory.
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects.
- Explore the behavior of variables, lists, tuples, and more.
- Learn about Python's `id()`, `is`, and `==` operators.

## 🏆 Tasks and Highlights

### 0. Who am I?
- **Task:** Write the function name to print the type of an object.
- **File:** `0-answer.txt`

### 1. Where are you?
- **Task:** Write the function name to get the variable identifier (memory address).
- **File:** `1-answer.txt`

### 2. Right count
- **Task:** Determine if two variables point to the same object.
- **File:** `2-answer.txt`

### 19. Copy a list object
- **Task:** Implement a function `copy_list` to return a copy of a list.
- **File:** `19-copy_list.py`

### 28. Same or not?
- **Task:** Analyze the behavior of `id()` with list operations.
- **File:** `28-answer.txt`

...and many more! Each task builds on your understanding of Python's object model. 🧠

## 🌟 Key Concepts

- **Mutable vs Immutable:**
  - Mutable objects (e.g., lists) can be changed in place.
  - Immutable objects (e.g., tuples, strings) cannot be changed after creation.

- **`id()` Function:** Returns the memory address of an object.
- **`is` vs `==`:**
  - `is` checks if two variables point to the same object.
  - `==` checks if two variables have the same value.
